## Maximising your use of this wiki.

This wiki assumes you already have a general knowledge of key java concepts, such as generics and object oriented programming.

If you are completely new to programming with Java, you should first take some Java lessons:

- [Codecademy: Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
- [W3Schools: Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [learnjavaonline.com](https://www.learnjavaonline.org/)

All content on this wiki uses Yarn mappings - if you aren't using Yarn mappings, you can use [Linkie](https://linkie.shedaniel.me/mappings) to convert between all mappings (mojmap/parchment etc.)

## Coming from Forge?

We currently do not have a page that lists the key differences between Forge and Fabric - however, you'll likely see some similarities to modding with Forge when reading through the pages on this wiki.

A page that lists the key differences is planned for the future.

## Extra help.

If you need extra help or certain concepts further clarified, you can ask in the `#mod-dev-` channels in the Fabric Discord - these channels are places where users give and ask for help with modding, please respect the Fabric Discord's rules.
