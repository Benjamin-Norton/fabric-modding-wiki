Creating Your First Mod

#description
These pages will introduce you to the Fabric toolchain, and modding as a whole.

:category-index-contents

## Information

These pages are great if you haven't created mods for Minecraft before - they will teach you how to create a project and utilize the many tools available, from Mixins to Access Wideners. 

However, they also assume you already have a general knowledge of key java concepts, such as generics and object oriented programming.

If you are completely new to programming with Java, you should first take some Java lessons:

- [Codecademy: Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
- [W3Schools: Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [learnjavaonline.com](https://www.learnjavaonline.org/)

All content on this wiki uses Yarn mappings - if you aren't using Yarn mappings, you can use [Linkie](https://linkie.shedaniel.me/mappings) to convert between all mappings (mojmap/parchment etc.)

## Extra help.

If you need extra help or certain concepts further clarified, you can ask in the `#mod-dev-` channels in the Fabric Discord - these channels are places where users give and ask for help with modding, please respect the Fabric Discord's rules.
