# Fabric Community Wiki

An open source guide-book for creating mods using Fabric.

## Jump Right In!

Whether you're new to modding or an experienced developer, the Fabric Community Wiki is a great resource for anyone looking to create Minecraft mods using the Fabric Loader. 

From step-by-step tutorials on creating your first mod to in-depth guides on adding items, blocks, and advanced rendering techniques, this comprehensive wiki has everything you need to get started and take your mods to the next level.

The sidebar contains all the pages that are on the wiki - if you do not see a topic that you seek help with, [create an issue on the GitHub](https://github.com/mineblock11/fabric-community-wiki/issues) or [join the discord for support.](https://discord.gg/UzHtJKqHny)

## Before you jump in...

This wiki assumes you already have a general knowledge of key java concepts, such as generics and object oriented programming.

If you are completely new to programming with Java, you should first take some Java lessons:

- [Codecademy: Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
- [W3Schools: Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [learnjavaonline.com](https://www.learnjavaonline.org/)

All content on this wiki uses Yarn mappings - if you aren't using Yarn mappings, you can use [Linkie](https://linkie.shedaniel.me/mappings) to convert between all mappings (mojmap/parchment etc.)

## Coming from Forge?

We currently do not have a page that lists the key differences between Forge and Fabric - however, you'll likely see some similarities to modding with Forge when reading through the pages on this wiki.

A page that lists the key differences is planned for the future.

## Extra Support

If you need extra help or certain concepts further clarified, you can ask in the `#mod-dev` channels in the Fabric Discord - these channels are places where users give and ask for help with modding, please respect the Fabric Discord's rules.
