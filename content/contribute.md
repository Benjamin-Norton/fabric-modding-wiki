Contribute

#description
We accept contributions from anyone - you are welcome to fork and create pull requests adding content.
::

<hr />

If you wish to contribute, please read these guidelines.

## Writing Style

Please write pages in American Standard English. If you feel it is nessecary, you can use the following free tools to correct grammatical and other errors with your writing:

- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
- [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/)

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Clarity is key.</strong></p>
    <p>Expect your reader to be new to the modding scene, mark any content that isn't intended for beginners using callouts.</p>
</div>

When adding images, place them in the `public` folder accordingly.

## Code

Please use yarn at all times when editing the wiki.

There are plans to use an automatic mapping conversion script - allowing readers to switch between Mojang Mappings, Parchment and Yarn, similar to the Fabric Wiki's yarn code block plugin. However, this is not currently implemented.

When writing code, please comment **key methods and fields**.

You must not use code from other projects into **any** pages - if this is impossible to satisfy, you may link the code's GitHub page if it is visible source.

## Markdown Extensions

You can create vue components to help aid the guides you write, but please don't make it exessive, all content should be in markdown, not in the components themselves.

Code blocks support the major programming languages.

```java
System.out.println("For example, this is Java.")
```

## Long-Term Contributors

If you want to become a long-term contributor/maintainer of the wiki, please shoot mineblock11 a DM on discord.
