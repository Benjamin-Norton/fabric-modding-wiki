## Information

These pages assume you have a basic knowledge of modding.

If you do not have a basic understanding of key concepts, you should follow the [Creating Your First Mod](/introduction/) guides first before continuing to these pages.

All content on this wiki uses Yarn mappings - if you aren't using Yarn mappings, you can use [Linkie](https://linkie.shedaniel.me/mappings) to convert between all mappings (mojmap/parchment etc.)

## Extra help.

If you need extra help or certain concepts further clarified, you can ask in the `#mod-dev-` channels in the Fabric Discord - these channels are places where users give and ask for help with modding, please respect the Fabric Discord's rules.
