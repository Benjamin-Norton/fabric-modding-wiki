# Launching the Game

To launch Minecraft with your mod installed, you can choose the "Minecraft Client" task in your Run Configurations list - it's recommended you launch in "Debug" mode as this will allow you to hotswap methods and create breakpoints where possible.

If the run configurations don't exist, reload the project. If they still dont exist, you can alternatively use the `gradlew runClient` command instead. This is not recommended though as hotswapping and various debug tools are not available.

You should see the game launch in development mode - you are unauthenticated and cannot join any online servers in this mode:

## Caveats

### Authentication

If you need to log into an actual account instead of being stuck in offline mode, you can utilize the ["DevLogin" library by PlanetTeamSpeakk](https://github.com/PlanetTeamSpeakk/DevLogin)

Simply add the following to the `build.gradle` file found in the root of your mod project:

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()

  // ...
}

dependencies {
  modImplementation "com.ptsmods:devlogin:3.3"

  // ...
}
```

Next, you'll need to add the `--msa-nostore` argument to your "Minecraft Client" run configuration:

Now, when launching the game, you will be prompted to authenticate with Microsoft.

If you wish to store the authentication token, simply replace `--msa-nostore` with the `--msa` argument. This is not recommended though.

### Hot Swapping

Hot Swapping is only available when the run configurations are ran in "Debug" mode - even then, you're still quite limited:

- You cannot hot-swap entire classes.
- You cannot hot swap anything inside of a Mixin class.
- You can hotswap the instructions of methods (including lambda functions)
